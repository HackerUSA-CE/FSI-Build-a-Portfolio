      Directions:
       <div> <FSi-Build-a-Portfolio</div>      
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        <h1>Myname is Prabhat Tiwari</h1>
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        <h2>I am a soft ware developer</h2>
       </div>
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        <hr>
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        <p> "My favorite Thing About programming is ____use JS & DOM______"</p>
        7. Make an image tag  with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
      <img alt="This is Prabhat in Arizona's Grand Canyan">
              Src = " https://placeholder.com /200/100" 
       >     
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        <p> This is "loren ipsm "</p>
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        <h3>This is "Prabhat's First Project"</h3>
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        <ul> 
          <li> "Project1"</li>
          <li> "Project2"</li>
          <li> "Project3"</li>
        </ul>
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)
<h3> "Contact Me"</h3>
<p> "phone: 202-555-1234"</p>
          <link> 
        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
